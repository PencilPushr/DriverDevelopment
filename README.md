# Project
The main idea behind this project is to:
A) Learn about Driver Development on Windows (WDM Framework)
B) Look more deeply into the internals of Windows, Operating Systems and Memory in general

Additionally, this driver aims to implement kernel security techniques, such as:
Detecting remote thread injection/dll injection
Dumping DLL/Drivers
Checking for registry access
Driver read/write memory
...
etc.
